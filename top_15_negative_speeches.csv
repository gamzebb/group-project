let us start current state economy growth slowed markedly last year overseas global growth slowed 3 yoy pppweighted 2019 weakest since 2009 uk economy barely grown since first quarter last year yoy

unusual growth slow much fiscal policy monetary conditions supportive bank rate remains negative real terms somewhat mpcs estimate neutral mortgage rates around record lows public spending picked markedly sum real government figure 1 uk gdp growth business surveys key factor behind slowdown persistently high policy uncertainty generated home abroad uk firms households faced brexitrelated uncertainties risks possible nodeal brexit uncertainties uks eventual trading relations eu elsewhere global level trade policy uncertainty surged see figure 4 tariffs uschina trade risen sharply actual threatened tariff hikes range economies sharp rise nontariff protectionist measures moreover broadening stated rationale measures initial focus addressing bilateral trade deficits include disputes intellectual property theft currency policy industrial subsidies structure domestic sales taxes migration policy means started dispute two countries much wider implications extensive evidence high uncertainty downside risks hinders economic growth firms households fear something bad might happen incentive defer major spending decisions large sunk costs high incentive wait greater appears possible uncertainty resolved soon follows recent persistent rolling uncertainty firms households keep expecting uncertainty resolved quarters ahead likely especially damaging spending gets deferred hope things little clearer uncertainty persists spending deferred moreover given brexitrelated uncertainties greater uk countries spending probably diverted elsewhere adverse effects high uncertainty evident data uk elsewhere world trade volumes year ago first significant decline since 2009 marked deterioration business confidence across many countries business investment growth across major advanced economies slowed 6 yoy late 2017 2 yoy uk business investment risen slightly real terms since brexit referendum mid2016 firms investment intentions remain weak exports suffered weaker world trade growth well decisions firms elsewhere diversify business relations supply chains away ukbased firms consumers turned cautious despite positive backdrop rising real wage growth low unemployment low mortgage rates household spending growth slowed around 1 yoy spare capacity prices labour market uncertainties brexit trade policy also hit potential growth example weak investment capped capital stock growth brexit contingency plans preparations absorbed resources result productivity growth fallen low oecd average since early 2018 even mpc judged last novembers mpr underlying growth recent quarters fallen slightly potential economy modest rising output gap roughly 14 gdp data since soft side hence output gap may little bigger perhaps 13 12 gdp view first glance view rising spare capacity might appear hard reconcile key labour market trends example private sector regular pay growth reached 4 yoy middle last year highest since 2008 moreover jobless rate roughly stable 4 since early last year lowest since mid1970s little mpcs estimate equilibrium jobless rate however pace average earnings growth last quarters probably overstates underlying trend recent strength probably reflects erratic compositional effects notably marked weakness employment lowpaying occupations unlikely persist guides not suggest pay growth continued strengthen last year example 12month median private pay deals fairly stable 275 since early last year survey guides pay growth levelled edged recently see figures 5 6 regular pay growth cooled bit last couple months mpcs central forecast agree average earnings growth 3 14 year moreover jobless rate useful guide labour market conditions not always give clear timely signal whether economy spare capacity whether slack rising slightly stable one issue estimates equilibrium jobless rate uncertain mpc estimates edged 5 4 14 recent years downtrend reflected various factors including changes tax benefit system increases less secure forms work improved educational attainment population ageing many ongoing suspect equilibrium jobless rate may fallen little perhaps around 4 hence close actual jobless rate evidence not yet decisive either way view jobless rate currently close equilibrium would view become stronger line mpcs november forecast softer tone pay growth last months sustained year second issue jobless rate usually reacts quite slowly changes output gap one reason costs changing headcount although generally less investment decisions hence firms might wait see changes demand sustained fully adjusting staff numbers result slowdowns economy tend reflected initially lower capacity use rise unemployment usually comes later example figure 7 shows typical response estimated period 2000 2019 q3 jobless rate relative equilibrium capacity use firms based range business surveys output gap rises 1 potential gdp remains constant variation time average capacity use falls sharply first couple quarters nearly one standard deviation firms react drop demand cutting jobs investment capacity use recovers somewhat unemployment rises eventually persistent output gap 1 gdp reflected persistent rise jobless rate 0405pp takes year two full rise unemployment come using figure 8 shows results persistent slight shortfall growth relative potential view similar current prospective situation output gap rises 1 potential gdp occurs gradually output gap rises 14 gdp two quarters 12 gdp four quarters 1 gdp eight quarters jobless rate would eventually rise 0405pp little occurs first quarters example three quarters output gap would reached 04pp gdp jobless rate would barely risen roughly 01pp well within margin error data contrast capacity use firms responds fairly promptly markedly implication trying judge whether recent economic growth trend sharp drop capacity use firms one standard deviation average across various business surveys probably least important fact jobless rate roughly stable inflation remains subdued core inflation slowed little 2 since late 2018 business surveys suggest firms expectations selling prices softened see figure 10 economy slowing recent pickup labour cost growth reflected marked squeeze margins rather higher prices profit share gdp recent quarters lowest since 2007 number profit warnings uk listed companies highest since 2002 recent business surveys suggest firms expectations profitability weak deterioration profitability also seems prompted tightening banks lending standards companies theory one might argue recent margin squeeze poses upside risk future inflation firms could seek rebuild margins higher prices sluggish demand restraining prices suspect likely margin squeeze passed backwards onto lower cost growth cutbacks corporate spending next leg slowdown transition declines capacity use profits weakness employment may underway example job growth slowed trends vacancies redundancies firms hiring intentions weakened markedly see figure 12 table 1 sum current situation economic growth sluggish spare capacity rising inflation subdued economy still slow puncture seems spreading labour market unless prospects demand improve

inactivity unemployment rates today much 1970s rise inactivity not concentrated among older men occurred among prime aged well see table 12 patterns increase however different older men rise inactivity concentrated 1970s 80s particularly following early 1980s recession stopped 1990s contrast prime aged inactivity continued rise present despite relatively buoyant labour market last eight years weakening low skill labour market discussed suggests might expect relatively larger increases inactivity among unskilled men see table 13 indeed case particularly prime age men among older age group higher skill groups access good early retirement packages consequence changes 50 60 per cent inactive prime age men bottom skill quartile furthermore relative situation low skilled worsened substantially since 1970s indeed using lfs definitions since early 1980s increase prime age inactivity among outside bottom skill quartile whereas inactivity rates low skilled risen inactive men age 25 report one four major categories namely fulltime student looking family early retired sick disabled primeage group around 70 per cent inactive report sick disabled older age group equivalent figure 50 per cent another 35 per cent early retired disability key factor understanding rise male inactivity pursue must first find many people report chronically ill table 14 see 20 per cent men aged 2564 report limiting longstanding illness llsi around 17 per cent reporting limiting health problem disability lhpd difference appears systematic perhaps case llsi illness limits things people normally whereas lhpd illness limits kind work person former apparently slightly broader category numbers llsi somewhat higher lhpd key facts emerge table 14 first proportion reporting llsi not risen systematically since late 1970s contrast numbers reporting lhpd rose steadily throughout different patterns incidence observed llsi lhpd may perhaps arise llsi less responsive decline labour demand lhpd directly refers work either way absolutely clear rise selfreported illness disability 1980s 90s relatively small compared rises inactivity turning skill based variations illness disability basic result prime age men bottom skill quartile around twice likely suffer limiting illness remainder differential grown systematically since 1970s closer 35 per cent older men differential smaller around 50 70 per cent risen strongly since 1970s already noted around 70 inactive prime age men report sickness disability reason inactivity unsurprisingly consistent around 71 75 group reporting llsi lhpd among older workers numbers little lower 60 probably significant group healthy early retirees among 55s recall 35 inactive 5564 year old men report early retirement opposed sickness disability inactivity lfs light typical person llsi lhpd inactive short answer see table 15 among primeage men majority limiting illness disability economically active however whereas 1970s mere 10 per cent group inactive late 1990s number risen without llsi also risen among without lhpd significant change since early 1980s use data plus changes incidence longstanding illness working age population table 14 work proportion dramatic rise inactivity among prime age men explained rise inactivity among limiting illness disability answer around 70 rise primeage male inactivity since 1970s accounted rising inactivity among llsi less rise since 1980s accounted rising inactivity among lhpd furthermore contribution due rising rates reported chronic illness see table 14 arises rising inactivity within group among older workers situation different around half rise inactivity since 1970s explained rising inactivity among without reported limiting illness expanding group would tend report lfs inactive early retirement rather sickness disability would consist mainly occupational pensioners taking early retirement ie prior age 65 option widely available particularly public sector occupations eg teachers doctors police civil servants already noted among primeage men bottom skill quartile around three four times likely inactive remainder primeage male population table 16 focus extent related incidence chronic illness disability find twothirds rise inactivity among chronically sick disabled around 60 per cent bottom skill quartile 1979 low skill men chronically sick contributed around 34 percentage point prime age male inactivity 2000 contributed nearly 3 percentage points despite less 6 per cent total population prime age men level concentration fact even higher use lfs data opposed ghs data see faggio nickell 2003 detail summarise therefore find rise inactivity among men heavily concentrated among chronic illness particularly low skill inactive chronically sick disabled claiming incapacity benefit invalidity benefit prior 1995 2001 50 per cent claimants suffering mental behavioural disorders mostly depression diseases musculoskeletal system mostly back pain 1979 equivalent fundamental economic change underlying significant weakening low skill labour market symptoms falling wage relative skilled shortage unskilled jobs one consequence would rise nonemployment rate low skill workers indeed happened question arises rise nonemployment heavily focussed inactivity opposed unemployment example unemployment rate among without qualifications fell 19 early 1980s around 12 late 1990s whereas inactivity rate among group rose multiple around three answer question first consider another given weakening labour market low skilled group would one expect particularly badly hit plausible answer would group additional disadvantage namely suffer potentially suffer longterm illness disability limits sort work story would proceed follows back early 1970s even men group low skills not tend withdraw labour force around 87 men category economically active time however find harder get work back 1970s longterm illness disability three times likely unemployed remainder work force lowskill labour market started weaken unskilled men actual potential chronic illness disability particularly badly hit low skill group found much harder get work operating social security system found much easier shift onto incapacity invalidity benefit thus example individuals hard place work advised 1989 furthermore doctors whose certification required benefit entitlement influenced assessment probability patients finding job ritchie et al 1993 last might termed push factors forces pushing men inactivity pull factors include fact invalidity benefits considerably higher available unemployed furthermore gap increased mid1980s mid1990s falling back later 1990s occurred operation additional pension system earnings related supplement invalidity benefit another factor pull side fact invalidity incapacity benefit system pressure take work minimal example beatty fothergill 1999 report survey workingage men not worked six months 5 per cent reporting longterm sick looking job
